      <!-- 1) Nebius -->
      <article class="mb-6 bg-card rounded-lg border border-border/40 shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Nebius</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Nebius is positioned as a growing force in cloud infrastructure and AI compute services, offering
          scalable, high-performance systems that support next-generation workloads. As demand for AI training,
          model deployment, and enterprise cloud solutions accelerates, Nebius stands to benefit from a structural
          tailwind in digital transformation. The stock currently trades at a discount relative to its long-term
          cloud adoption potential, giving long-term investors an attractive entry point into an expanding market.

      <!-- 2) BigBear.ai -->
      <article class="mb-6 bg-card rounded-lg border border-border/40 shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">BigBear.ai (BBAI)</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          BigBear.ai provides AI-driven analytics and decision-intelligence platforms used in defense, logistics,
          and industrial operations. With governments and large enterprises increasingly relying on predictive
          analytics to improve efficiency and security, BigBear.ai offers real technological value. Despite
          meaningful long-term prospects, the stock is undervalued due to short-term revenue fluctuations. Its
          discounted valuation creates a favorable long-term setup as adoption of AI-enabled decision systems grows.

      <!-- 3) Applied Digital -->
      <article class="mb-6 bg-card rounded-lg border border-border/40 shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Applied Digital (APLD)</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Applied Digital builds high-capacity data infrastructure, powering AI workloads, high-performance
          computing systems, and cloud compute. As AI models grow dramatically in size and complexity, demand
          for specialized data centers surges—and Applied Digital is strategically expanding to meet it. The
          company is in a sector with massive future demand, yet its stock currently trades well below intrinsic
          value due to early-stage volatility, making the long-term outlook compelling.

      <!-- 4) Serve Robotics -->
      <article class="mb-6 bg-card rounded-lg border border-border/40 shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Serve Robotics (SERV)</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Serve Robotics is pioneering autonomous delivery solutions with scalable, low-cost sidewalk robots.
          As demand for last-mile automation increases across retail, food delivery, and urban logistics, Serve is
          positioned to capture a growing market that values cost efficiency and sustainability. Despite being early
          in its growth cycle, Serve trades significantly below its long-term potential, offering deep-value upside
          for patient investors.

      <!-- 5) Rigetti -->
      <article class="bg-card rounded-lg border border-border/40 shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Rigetti Computing (RGTI)</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Rigetti is a major U.S. quantum computing innovator building scalable quantum processors targeting
          breakthroughs in optimization, research, and AI acceleration. Quantum computing remains in early
          development, but global enterprise and government spending is rapidly increasing. Rigetti’s technological
          roadmap and partnerships create meaningful long-term value, even though the stock price remains heavily
          discounted relative to future commercial quantum demand.
